## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

- At first, I linked the `style.css` file and the Google Fonts CDN with `index.html`.
- Then, imported the colors from `style-guide.md` into the `style.css` file. After that, I initialized the css file and set necessary parameters (such as, font-families, colours, font-sizes, page backgound etc.) for this project.
- Then, I wrote necessary code to reach the given _UI Design Sample_ and also added necessary css styles to match it with the _UI Design Sample_.
- After that, I wrote the necessary CSS MEDIA QUERIES for mobile device view of this project.
- Finally, I wrote necessary `javascript` codes to check whether all form fields are filled or not and also validate email address when Submit button is **clicked**.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to check if all the form fields are filled or not.
